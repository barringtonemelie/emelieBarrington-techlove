## About 

A test project created by Emelie Barrington for Techlove. It is a simple web app that fetches and renders repositories, along with specific information about them, from Githubs REST API.

There are two main branches of interest - the 'main' branch contains my attempt at creating reusable components for this project. The branch 'less-components' contains the original structure of my project, which I initially felt made more sense and had less code. However, if working in a team, the current main branch code might be easier to read and maintain, especially if the project were to grow. In both branches, I have used the Button component from my own library of reusable components, which has been refactored into TSX.

## Tech stack

This is a frontend only application. It was built using Vite, React, TypeScript and Tailwind. 


## Fun facts

- The Button component and the tailwind styling config is from my personal library of reusable components
- This is my first ever attempt at TypeScript and I really enjoyed it!
