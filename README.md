## About 

A test project created by Emelie Barrington for Techlove. It is a simple web app that fetches and renders repositories and some specified information about them from Githubs REST API.

## Tech stack

This is a frontend only application. It was built using Vite, React, TypeScript and Tailwind. 


## Fun facts

- The Button component and the tailwind styling config is from my personal library of reusable components
- This is my first ever attempt at TypeScript and I really enjoyed it!
